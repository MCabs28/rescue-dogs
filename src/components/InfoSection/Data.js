    description: 'Pet stores sell animals only to earn money. Most of the animals sold in such stores were raised in breeding farms where they were crammed into tiny and filthy cages or containers. These factories mass produce animals like products and often ignore their basic needs. Many are shipped to pet stores in tight containers and arrive malnourished, sick, or injured. Dead or dying animals are considered part of the cost of the business. When you buy an animal, you are supporting these cruel breeding farms, and another animal will be bred to replace it. It is a cycle of never ending misery.',

In our shelter, we welcome stray or abandoned animals and we provide them with veterinary attention, food, water and shelter and we find a new home for them. In order to adopt one of our dogs we have a process: we visit the new home and ask for a small payment for the adoption. Our intention is to be 100% sure that these animals receive the second chance they deserve.',
